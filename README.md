## About me
I was born and bred in Thokoza, a township located in the south of the City of Ekurhuleni. I enjoy reading academic papers as well as 
some Netflix and chill. I am currently doing my Masters in Economic Science at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
My university degrees gave me an excellent combination of skills in pure mathematics, applied mathematics,
economics and finance. I am enthusiastic, respectful and curious.
I have a
passion for solving different problems in different disciplines, this helps me main
tain a solutionist type of thinking
. My passion for the economy and
corporate drives me to always learn and sharpen my skills as an upcoming young pr
ofessional
and aspiring economist.
